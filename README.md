This is an interactive dashboard built to visualize New York State census data and population statistics. It is able to display a variety of demographics for each county in the state, as well as provide clean and intuitive visualizations for said data.


**INSTALLATION**

Download or clone the git repository. In order to view the dashboard, open up a terminal in the root directory and install a node.js http server via the command `npm install --global http-server`. After installation of the server has finished, execute the command `http-server -c-1`. Then, open up an internet browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. 

Node.js http server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
