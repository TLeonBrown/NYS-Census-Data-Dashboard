In this project, I will be creating an intuitive, interactive dashboard that looks at population, demographic, and income changes, as well as many other variables, in each county in New York state over the past 100 years. By doing this, I hope to determine the reasons why, despite having large influxes of immigrants, New York state has some of the lowest population growth percentages out of any state in the United States.


**INSTALLATION**

Download or clone the git repository. In order to view the dashboard, open up a terminal in the root directory and execute the command `http-server -c-1`. Then, open up an internet browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox) and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
